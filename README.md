# Password Generator

## About
This project was very fun and not too difficult of a first challenge into JavaScript. I learned quite a few things including:
- QuerySelector
- GetElementByID
- AddEventListener
- Factoring
- ForLoops
- Math.random
- Math.floor
- array.Concat
---
Looking forward to applying these skill into deeper JS applications. 5 Star Project, would recommend for beginners!
